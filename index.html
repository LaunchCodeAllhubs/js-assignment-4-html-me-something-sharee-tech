            I began my undergraduate studies in mathematics at Utah State
            University. I grew up in a family of mathematicians and scientists,
            so it was natural that I follow that path. I completed two years of
            coursework in math prior to changing my major to music.

            Though I had always loved music, I found myself drawn to the organ
            because it evoked a wider range and deeper intensity of emotions
            than I had experienced with any other instrument—from poignant
            tender feelings, to dark struggle, to joyous jubilance. I discovered
            I was finding and connecting with myself through this new found
            medium.

            After completing my bachelors degree at USU in organ performance, I
            went to KU for grad school. As a new masters student in the organ
            program, I was intimated by the playing of the veteran masters and
            doctorate level students. Overwhelmed as I was, I dove into my
            practicing and studies, and also worked as an organist in several
            local congregations.
